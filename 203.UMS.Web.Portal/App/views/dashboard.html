                    <h2>Welcome to uManage!</h2>
                    <p>You have successfully installed uManage and are almost ready to start letting users access the system. There are a few more setup tasks to complete but they are all fairly painless and straightforward. At this point, you have setup the application, connected to the database, and connected to the directory.</p>
                    <p>The next steps all have to do with configuring uManage to work how you want it to work. These steps are typically needed for most installations:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Configure Administrative Users &amp; Roles</li>
                        <li>Configure Locations</li>
                        <li>Configure Optional Settings</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Feature Requests</h3>
