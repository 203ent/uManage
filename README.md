Project Description
-------------------
uManage is an Active Directory Self-Service Portal application designed for use on intranet systems. Users can update their information without IT assistance.

Why uManage?
------------
Do you use Active Directory in your organization? If so we're pretty sure you have policies for passwords and user's information. But who gets stuck resetting passwords or more importantly updating user's information when they move from one location to another? Typically someone in the IT department is stuck with these tasks. uManage aims to fix that problem by allowing users to manage their own information and more importantly still allow the IT department to control the information being updated.
